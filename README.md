# Pig Game
The Pig game is a two-player dice game that challenges players to be the first to reach a score of 100 points. Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish, accumulating points with each roll. However, if a player rolls a one, they lose all the points they have accumulated during their turn and the other player gets a chance to roll. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100 points, at which point they are declared the winner.

- Play continues back and forth between the two players until one player reaches a score of 100 points or more.
